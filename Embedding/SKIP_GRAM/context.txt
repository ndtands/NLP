Instead of taking out a loan to buy a house, Thu Hoai decided to buy a car worth nearly VND1 billion (over $43,000) and keep sharing a room with friends.
After more than eight years of working, the 32-year-old tour guide had accumulated over VND1 billion.

Hoai's initial plan was to buy an apartment in the capital and have her mother move in with her.

The apartment she wished to purchase cost more than VND2 billion.

Hoai intended to borrow more than VND400 million from the bank, with an interest rate of 10 percent a year for the next five years. If Hoai takes the loan, she would have to use up half her monthly salary - nearly VND10 million - to repay the interest and part of principal every month

During the first two years of the global pandemic, her income dropped while the price of apartments in early 2022 increased by another several hundred million dong.

Feeling that the harder she tried, the harder it became to buy a house, Hoai ended up buying a car with half her savings after the Lunar New Year in early this month.

She put half of the remaining money in a saving account and in stocks.

Hoai is among many Vietnamese citizens who've had to give up on their dreams of owning a house in big cities because of prices rising to unaffordable levels and their incomes getting slashed by the pandemic.

According to real estate services provider Colliers Vietnam, the average prices of apartments in HCMC increased by 15 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of last year, the fastest rate in the country. Meanwhile, the prices of apartments in Hanoi rose by 5-10 percent, with most new ones being developed in the west and east of the city.

In an early 2022 VnExpress survey, 76 percent of the respondents said they had delayed their home-buying plans due to Covid-19. Among them, 45.6 percent said the delay would be long term, while 30.4 percent said it would be short term.
